# Quick start guide

Let's install GCPDecompositions
and run our first **G**eneralized **CP** Tensor **Decomposition**!

## Step 1: Install Julia

Go to [https://julialang.org/downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads)
and install the current stable release.

To check your installation,
open up Julia and try a simple calculation like `1+1`:
```@repl
1 + 1
```

More info: [https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/getting-started/)

## Step 2: Install GCPDecompositions

GCPDecompositions can be installed using
Julia's excellent builtin package manager.

```julia-repl
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("GCPDecompositions")
```

This downloads, installs, and precompiles GCPDecompositions
(and all its dependencies).
Don't worry if it takes a few minutes to complete.

!!! tip "Tip: Interactive package management with the Pkg REPL mode"

    Here we used the [functional API](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/api/)
    for the builtin package manager.
    Pkg also has a very nice interactive interface (called the Pkg REPL)
    that is built right into the Julia REPL!

    Learn more here: [https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/)

!!! tip "Tip: Pkg environments"

    The package manager has excellent support
    for creating separate installation environments.
    We strongly recommend using environments to create
    isolated and reproducible setups.

## Step 3: Run GCPDecompositions

Let's create a simple three-way (a.k.a. order-three) data tensor
that has a rank-one signal plus noise!

```@repl quickstart
dims = (10, 20, 30)
X = ones(dims) + randn(dims);    # semicolon suppresses the output
```

Mathematically,
this data tensor can be written as follows:

```math
X
=
\underbrace{
    \mathbf{1}_{10} \circ \mathbf{1}_{20} \circ \mathbf{1}_{30}
}_{\text{rank-one signal}}
+
N
\in
\mathbb{R}^{10 \times 20 \times 30}
,
```

where
``\mathbf{1}_{n} \in \mathbb{R}^n`` denotes a vector of ``n`` ones,
``\circ`` denotes the outer product,
and
``N_{ijk} \overset{iid}{\sim} \mathcal{N}(0,1)``.

Now, to get a rank ``r=1`` GCP decomposition simply load the package
and run `gcp`.

```@repl quickstart
using GCPDecompositions
r = 1  # desired rank
M = gcp(X, r)
```

This returns a `CPD` (short for **CP** **D**ecomposition)
with weights ``\lambda`` and factor matrices ``U_1``, ``U_2``, and ``U_3``.
Mathematically, this is the following decomposition
(read [Overview](@ref) to learn more):

```math
M
=
\sum_{i=1}^{r}
\lambda[i]
\cdot
U_1[:,i] \circ U_2[:,i] \circ U_3[:,i]
\in
\mathbb{R}^{10 \times 20 \times 30}
.
```

We can extract each of these as follows:

```@repl quickstart
M.λ    # to write `λ`, type `\lambda` then hit tab
M.U[1]
M.U[2]
M.U[3]
```

Let's check how close
the factor matrices ``U_1``, ``U_2``, and ``U_3``
(which were estimated from the noisy data)
are to the true signal components
``\mathbf{1}_{10}``, ``\mathbf{1}_{20}``, and ``\mathbf{1}_{30}``.
We use the angle between the vectors
since the scale of each factor matrix isn't meaningful on its own
(read [Overview](@ref) to learn more):

```@repl quickstart
using LinearAlgebra: normalize
vecangle(u, v) = acos(normalize(u)'*normalize(v))  # angle between vectors in radians
vecangle(M.U[1][:,1], ones(10))
vecangle(M.U[2][:,1], ones(20))
vecangle(M.U[3][:,1], ones(30))
```

The decomposition does a pretty good job
of extracting the signal from the noise!

The power of **Generalized** CP Decomposition
is that we can fit CP decompositions to data
using different losses (i.e., different notions of fit).
By default, `gcp` uses the (conventional) least-squares loss,
but we can easily try another!
For example,
to try non-negative least-squares simply run

```@repl quickstart
M_nonneg = gcp(X, 1; loss = GCPLosses.NonnegativeLeastSquares())
```

!!! tip "Congratulations!"

    Congratulations!
    You have successfully installed GCPDecompositions
    and run some Generalized CP decompositions!
